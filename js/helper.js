//maybe ill leave code comments actually maybe not because it is just going to be an easy excuse for having un

//but if i were to do this i would have the date 1/8/2026 of writing it as scatterd thoughts across the codebase
//that will probably get annoying to remove

//can't break the streak ahh commit //(cooked repo)
