When I was younger, I was really fascinated by "1-year challenges"

What I mean by this is projects where it's updated every day, about once a day

Take Twitter for Android by jacksfilms, or my own personal ones, I did in middle school, where I sent my friend a picture of a cat once a day for a year, and another person an orange

## This is a mini send-off to web development

I used to be very obsessed with web development, to the point that I was known as the web development guy to some of my friends

But it feels limiting for me to be stuck to that

I've always been averse to being just one identity

I'm by no means quitting web development (Relay Superposition Development), so much as this being a "send off" from that identity 

A rite of passage of sorts

## Minimum of one commit per day

I've always wanted to do these one-year projects, but I'm often scared off by the time-to-output tradeoff

That isn't to say I only work for the payoff, so much as I don't want to invest time into art that doesn't feel expressive

And to extend upon this being an art project,

## No AI Usage
Not that it would have been used in the first place, but it feels good to explicitly state it for anyone who wants my take on the manner

## Modding
I was thinking that since I'm choosing to use elements instead of a canvas element to render things, that makes it extremeley easy to cheat in this game

But even then this is not a multiplayer game, so cheating is in it's own way an experience

In fact, I think adding modding would be a fun experience

I'm thinking of something similar to how Spectator's modding may be where there's simple mods and complex mods (or i guess Minecraft's datapack vs Java mods)

That may entail setting assets in a JSON or running full blown custom js (with a disclaimer that whatever you run is your own risk)
